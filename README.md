- 👋 Hi, I’m @taimoorshahzada and I love to code the designs. I have a passion and because of this passion I decided to create this profile and bring concepts
and inspirations to web designing. 
I have done tons of web designing projects. And here to teach you Web Development, Frontend Development with advanced techniques and BackEnd.
I want you to understand how the designs speak and give you an idea of HTML, CSS and JavaScript.
